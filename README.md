# Silent Node.js Server Startup Failure

This repository demonstrates a rare and difficult-to-debug issue in Node.js where a server might fail to start without providing a clear error message.  This can occur due to port conflicts or limitations in OS resources.

## Problem

The provided `server.js` attempts to start a simple HTTP server. However, under certain conditions (e.g., the port is already in use, or there are resource constraints on the system), the server might fail to start without any apparent error message or console output.

## Solution

The `serverSolution.js` offers an improved approach. By explicitly handling errors during server creation and listen, the code provides more robust error handling to diagnose the reasons for startup failure more clearly.  This includes checks for 'EADDRINUSE' errors (address already in use).
